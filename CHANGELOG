# CHANGELOG UPDATES

## 1.95.2
* reduce verbosity of check_renew_lock log
* install pho_ldm.h with phobos-devel
* add network-online After condition
* do not attempt to find a new medium for a write if no drive is available

## 1.95.1
* common: add xmalloc, xstrdup, xcalloc...
* ltfs: improve ltfs log with serial number
* ltfs: return an error if labels are different at mount operation
* pho_srl_lrs : fixed typedef name that was already used
* store, admin, cli: fix store and admin global context share
* LRS : fix unloading a tape from a source which is not a slot
* compilation : fix gcc compilation warning on RHEL 9 based system
* doc : add documentation for the currently_dedicated_to option
* tests: fix acceptance invalid bash syntax
* tests: fix an issue between test_store and test-driver
* tests: verify database after migration is as expected
* TLC (Tape Library Controler): introduce first features of this component even
  if the daemon is still unused (library open/close, drive_lookup, load)

## 1.95
* WARNING: the db schema moves from 1.93 to 1.95 and a migration is needed.
* Unused 'disk' value is removed from media and device family.
* compute XXH128 extent checksum in raid1 layout during put
* compute MD5 extent checksum in raid1 layout during put
* Retrieve MD5 and XXH128 checksums at extent listing
* Phobos API has been changed. Any call to a Phobos function must be done after
  initializing its context using `phobos_init()`. To release the context, use
  `phobos_fini()`.
* Add scripts and a binary to test tape library
* The "phobos_admin_format" API function has been modified to be able to format
media whose status is not blank. A "force" parameter is added to manage this.
* Locate update for pre-locking
    - We add two new parameters to the "phobos_locate" API call: 'focus_host'
      and 'nb_new_lock'.
    - We add the '--focus-host' option to the "phobos locate obj" command.
* Phobos CLI is updated. The options '--layout' and '--lyt-params' can also
  be respectively spelled '--lyt' and '--layout-params' for consistency.
* Creation of I/O schedulers for efficient request handling by the LRS:
    - FIFO and Group Read
    - Fair Share
* Added tape library certification tests to verify Phobos is usable with the
  targeted library
* Added designs for the media statistics, SCSI error management, Tape Library
  Controler.
* Add SCSI logs.
* Add TLC daemon unused and incomplete draft version.

## 1.94.1

* Added RADOS as data storage backend (no package available yet)
* Added module-loader to manage io, fs, dev, lib and layout adapters dynamically
* Added drive migrate command
* Improved command documentation
* Internal LRS parallelization (read, write and format managed by device
  threads)
* Added locate modification design
* Modified drive lock API and command:
    - The "phobos xxx lock" API has changed: '--force' option is removed. The
option was only considered with devices, so removing it for media will not alter
its behavior.
    - The "phobos drive lock" API has changed: '--wait' option is added. Its
behavior is the same as the previous '--force' option.

## 1.94

* The "phobos_admin_format" API function has been modified to be able to send
multiple format requests in a single call. The medium id provided thus becomes
an array of medium ids, and the length of that array is added as a parameter.

* The "phobos_admin_format" API function has been modified to be able to limit
the number of concurrent format sent to the phobosd. A "nb_streams" parameter
is added to the parameters of the function, with 0 signifying "send all requests
at once".

## 1.93

* The "simple" layout is no longer available. It cannot be used through the CLI
and will not be recognized in the API anymore. Instead, an alias has been
provided in the default template.conf, emulating the "simple" layout behaviour.
The layout used is "raid1", with a replica count set to 1.
